## Hi there 👋

I’m Kaung Khant, a Computer Science student based in Toronto.

I enjoy building web applications and learning how things work behind the scenes.
If I have an idea, I like turning it into a real project and improving it step by step.

My main tech stack includes React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Java, Node.js, and Express.
I’m especially interested in Full-Stack web development and continuously learning new tools and frameworks.

I’ve been working on personal and school projects to improve my skills and build a strong foundation for my future career.

GitHub repositories for my school courses can be found on my Github Profile.
